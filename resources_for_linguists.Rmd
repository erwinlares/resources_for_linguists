# Step 0 - Operationalize your analysis 
This is where you make explicit what your measuring (accuracy â‰  precision), what it represents and why it is valid.

The validity of the models is informed by theory, existing literature, intuition, and observations.

# Working with means
Imagine that you're working with F0 measurements made with a population of speakers. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/F0.csv")
```
# Is this valid data?

```{r}

data |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = F0)) +
    geom_jitter()

```
Does this data tell you much about the population?

```{r}

data |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = F0, color = gender)) +
    geom_jitter()
    

```

```{r}

data |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = F0)) +
    geom_density()

```

```{r}

data |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = F0, color = gender)) +
    geom_jitter() +
    geom_hline(color = "blue", yintercept = data |> filter(gender == "M") |> pull(F0) |> mean()) +
    geom_hline(color = "red", yintercept = data |> filter(gender == "F") |> pull(F0) |> mean())
```
## Quantitative analysis 

We have a good idea that the two populations have different F0s. How do we go about "proving" that is the case?

A t test can be very useful when you are comparing measurements of tendency in a population.


```{r}
vector_m <- data |> filter(gender == "M") |> pull(F0)
vector_f <- data |> filter(gender == "F") |> pull(F0)


t.test(vector_m, vector_f)

```

# Classification problem

Here's the problem. I asked a bunch of people to judge whether a sentence they hear was meant to be interpreted as literal or idiomatic. How do they do?

Here's why operationalizing is very important. 

```{r}

data <- read_csv("data/perception.csv")

glimpse(data)

data |> 
    ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = n_success, y = expected), fill = "goldenrod", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_col(aes(x = n_success, y = observed), fill = "forestgreen", alpha = 0.5)

```

How do we go about "proving" that the differences are sufficiently different?

```{r}

chisq.test(data$expected, data$observed)

```
